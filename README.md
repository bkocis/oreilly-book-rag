Learn from your PDF books - build quizzes, Q&A, and chat for learning from your books.

## Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution for creating an interactive quiz-based learning platform from O'Reilly books. The system transforms static PDF content into dynamic, engaging learning experiences through AI-powered quiz generation, adaptive learning paths, and comprehensive progress tracking.

## Key Features

### ðŸ“š Document Processing
- **PDF Parsing**: Extract text, metadata, and structure from O'Reilly books
- **Smart Chunking**: Optimized content segmentation for quiz generation
- **Vector Indexing**: Fast semantic search using embeddings and vector databases

### ðŸŽ¯ Quiz Generation
- **Multiple Question Types**: Multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, short answer
- **Concept-Based Questions**: Focus on key concepts, definitions, and examples
- **Application Questions**: Real-world scenarios and practical applications
- **Code Questions**: Programming-specific questions for technical books
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Questions adjust based on user performance

### ðŸ§  Learning Intelligence
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed analytics and learning insights
- **Spaced Repetition**: Optimized review scheduling for better retention
- **Knowledge Gap Analysis**: Identify areas needing improvement
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Customized learning paths

### ðŸŽ® Gamification
- **Points & Badges**: Reward system for achievements
- **Learning Streaks**: Daily study motivation
- **Leaderboards**: Social learning competition
- **Study Groups**: Collaborative learning features

### ðŸ“Š Analytics Dashboard
- **Performance Visualization**: Charts and graphs showing learning progress
- **Mastery Tracking**: Subject and topic proficiency levels
- **Study Insights**: Detailed learning analytics and recommendations
- **Export Reports**: Share progress with instructors or peers
